            <p>2. Fun Facts</p><br>
            <p>This project took inspiration from my love of water parks</p>
            <p>I like both indoor and outdoor</p>
            <p>My favorite part of the project was making the Javascript</p>
            <p>The CSS was actually the most difficult part</p>
